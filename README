FMongo is a library for interacting with MongoDB from F#.

  * Strongly typed wrapper over a MongoDB collection
  * Mapping to and from many F# types, including all primitive types, records, unions, tuples, lists, arrays, dictionaries, and classes with public read/write fields/properties.
	* Basic quotation querying - some edge cases to work out (you can still use it alongside the full feature set provided by MongoDB.Driver).
	* Early release. Passes only basic tests.
